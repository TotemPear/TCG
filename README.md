## Installation

- Download the program [here](https://github.com/TotemPear/TCG/releases/download/v0.0.4-alpha/BakaTCG-Installer.zip).
- Extract `BakaTCG-Installer.exe` from it and put it somewhere accesible such as your desktop.
- Open the installer and wait for it to download :)

> [!WARNING]
> The executable and even the zip file in itself will probably get flagged as a virus by Windows Defender(or whatever antivirus you're using) so you will need to disable the antivirus before trying anything. Sorry but I can't do anything about that :/
